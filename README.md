# Freddy-Quito-Portfolio

## Description

This project is one of many portfolios to come. This is a project that I could build to my style to be user-friendly and easy to navigate. It motivated me to know I will create something and watch it become live. I built this porject to showcase my skills and talents for a future employer. This project highlights my strongest work and deployed web applications. You can naviagte through the top links to find information about me, my works, and contacts. Each picture will navigate you to the delopyed page for all to see. Through this project I learned how to apply many new properties in css. For example flexbox, media queries and css variables. All as box-styling, css-resets and pseudo elements which you can find in this project.
